## Writeup

* Did you implement bonus point?
Yes, Local Storage is implemented when there is a change in state.
* What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
Some React features were updated and had to look at the documentation for the changes, behavior of redux and states was challenging. Placing ships on the board was one of the very challenging parts. Additionally, having the reducers set for the free game and normal game was very challenging.
Additionally, having the reducers set up for the free game and normal game was very challenging.
